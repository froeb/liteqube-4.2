This config file changes the type of logging for dpkg from
  #log /var/log/dpkg.log
  to
  status-logger "/usr/bin/logger -t dpkg -p info"

# New Configuration: status-logger "/usr/bin/logger -t dpkg -p info"

This line replaces the standard file logging with a more complex logging mechanism.
- /usr/bin/logger is a command-line utility used to create entries in the system's syslog.
- The -t dpkg option sets the tag for log entries to dpkg. This tag is used to identify all log messages coming from dpkg.
- The -p info option sets the priority of the log messages to info. In syslog, priority is a combination of facility and level; info is a standard log level indicating informational messages.

Essentially, this configuration makes dpkg log its status messages through the system's syslog facility instead of just writing them into a plain file. This can be beneficial for centralized logging and better integration with system-wide log management.

# Implications of the Change
- *Centralized Logging*: By using logger, dpkg logs can be managed along with other system logs, which is helpful for centralized log management especially in complex systems or networks.
- *System Monitoring and Analysis*: This configuration can integrate better with tools that monitor and analyze syslog, providing more streamlined log analysis.
- *Flexibility*: Syslog offers more flexibility in managing logs, such as routing them to different destinations, filtering, or even forwarding them to remote log servers.
