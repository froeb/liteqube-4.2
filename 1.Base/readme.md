This directory contains the instalaltion and uninstall scripts.

The install script does not use pipewire, so it will need to be updated at a later stage to be compatible with Qubes 4.2
The uninstall script does only remove the four newly created qubes/vms, no other changes are made, so if we are ambitious,
at one later point one needs to do more of a clean up here.

There have been no changes made to these two shell files at this point.

Comments and changes on files in the subdirectories can be found in the readme.md files in the respective subdirectories.

For our purpose of adapting litequbes to Qubes 4.2 and Debian 12, the default directory will be especially relevant
