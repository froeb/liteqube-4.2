This folder can be used to customise Liteqube installation.

'custom.sh' script will be run after main installation completes. Any files listed in the 'permissions' file will be installed to appropriate qubes. Look at 'permissions' file in the '../default' folder to see some examples.

Aboove is the comment from the original author. Here are m (KF) additional findings so far:

This seems to allow to put additional files in the root directory (debian-core/root) of the vm/qube
and in the home directory of the vm/wube (dom0/home/user).

The file custom.sh seems to be teh most important file in this directory,
and it seems to be run at the creatiomn of the vm/qube.

It is unclear to me though at the moment where this is stored and how you adopt it for the various VM/Qubes to be created.

It seems that the files in this directory are meant to overwrite the files in the default directory for specific qubes.
(and the files in the default directory are meant to overwrite the files in the debian-12-minimal template?)
