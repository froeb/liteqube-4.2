In this directory, so far only the reference for the basic template to be 
used has been updated to debian-12-minimal instead of debian-11-minimal
in the lib.sh file.

The basic work seems to happen in that lib.sh file.

the first two sh-files, check-with-local.sh and especially fill-empty.sh are only relevant for github.
The last two files are for file premissions, I will look into this later in greater details, if needed.
For now all this can be left unchanged except for the minimal change above.
